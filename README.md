#Black Desert Market API (Service)
This project was created with intentions of simplifying access to Central Market data for Black Desert Online.
The service project is intended to be ran as a service in a Docker container, where many other applications or services may access it remotely.

##Features

##Road Map
* Basic fetch of market data from central market using item name or item ID.
* Docker containerization.
* Advanced fetch and error handling.
* Caching of items to reduce API usage (configurable)
* Advanced and simplified connection creation.
* Configurable logging levels (using basic environment variable)

##Todo List
* Refactor various API classes into the API project for import by other projects.
